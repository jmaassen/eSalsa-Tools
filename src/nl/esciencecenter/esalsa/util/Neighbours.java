	 * Retrieve a 3x3 matrix containing the amount of communication needed for all neighbors for the given source coordinate.
	 * 
	 * The communication is stored in the matrix as follows:
	 *  
	 *    0   1   2
	 * 0 [NW, N, NE]   
	 * 1 [ W, -, E ]
 	 * 2 [SW, S, SE]   
 	 * 
	 * The middle entry (i.e., result[1][1]) is always 0 as it represents the source coordinate. 
	 * 
	 * If the {@code boundaryW} is set to CLOSED and the source coordinate is at the left edge of the grid (x=0), 
	 * the NW, W, and SW entries will contain 0.  
	 * 
	 * If the {@code boundaryW} is set to CLOSED and the source coordinate is at the right edge of the grid (x=grid.width-1), 
	 * the NE, E, and SE entries will contain 0. 
	 * 
	 * If the {@code boundaryV} setting is set to CLOSED and the source coordinate is at the top of the grid (y=grid.height-1), 
	 * the NE, N, and NW entries will contain 0.  
	 *  
	 * If the {@code boundaryV} setting is set to CLOSED or TRIPOLE and the source coordinate is at the bottom of the grid (y=0),  
	 * the SE, S, and SW entries will contain 0. 
	 *
	 * In addition, entries may be 0 if the neighbor represents a land-only block.  
	 *
	 * @param c the source coordinate.  
	 * @return a 3x3 matrix containing the amount of communication needed for each neighbor of the given source coordinate.
